## ‚ö° Summary

This document is not documentation. It is resistance.

**Born from:** Ages 18-24, living under civil collapse  
**Built for:** Those who code from necessity, not luxury  
**Purpose:** Computing from the heart, with purpose, running with heart

## ü§ù Solidarity

Built in solidarity with everyone who has been:
- Told their problems don't exist
- Promised help that never arrived
- Forced to build what should have been provided
- Made to feel guilty for needing basic dignity

You are not alone. Your struggle is valid. Your resistance matters.
